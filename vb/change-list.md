### Minor changes

1. Binary string comparisons are always used for conditional compilation. Otherwise, string comparisons would not work because text string comparisons depend on the run-time culture. [3.1.2]
2. Types cannot inherit from a type that is directly or indirectly contained within it. Also clarified the examples. [4.3]
3. Changed the grammar and spec so that enumerated types can use the `System` equivalents of the fundamental types as an underlying type. [7.4]
4. We now allow a conversion between an array of an enumerated type and an array of the underlying type of the enumeration. [8.5, 8.8. 8.9]
5. When overriding a method, you can override it with a `MustOverride` method, causing it to become abstract. [4.5.1]
6. A type member can handle an event in its own class using `Handles`. [9.2.6]
7. Methods and properties that are declared `Overrides` now assume `Overloads`, which is more logical than assuming `Shadows`. [4.3.3]
8. Fields and local variables are allowed to initialize multiple variables at once using the `As``New` syntax. [9.6]
9. Removed the restriction that an inner `Catch` block cannot branch into an outer `Try` block. [10.10.1.2]
10. Classes cannot inherit from `System.MulticastDelegate`. [7.5.1]
11. Shared variables in structures can have initializers. [9.6.3]
12. Added a rule that numeric types are preferred over enumerated types when doing overload resolution against the literal 0. [11.8.1]
13. Array size initializers can explicitly state a lower bound of zero. [9.6.3.3]
14. Added an external checksum directive. [3.4]
15. Array-size initializers on fields are allowed to be non-constant expressions. [9.6.3.3]
16. Keywords with type characters are now treated as identifiers. [2.2]
17. Constants, fields, properties, locals and parameters that have the same name as their type can be interpreted either as the member or the type for the purposes of member lookup. [11.6.1]
18. Added a section talking about types restricted by the .NET Framework and moved discussion of `System.Void` to that section. [7, 7.13]
19. When dealing with a project and a referenced assembly that define the same fully-qualified name, the project's type is preferred, otherwise the name is ambiguous. [4.7.2, 11.4.4]
20. `On``Error` statements do not extend over the call to `New` at the beginning of a constructor. [10.10.2]
21. Resolving an overloaded call to a late bound call is disallowed if the containing type is an interface. [11.8.1]
22. `Overloads` and `Shadows` are not allowed in a standard module. [4.3.3]
23. When looking up in interfaces, a name shadowed in one path through the hierarchy is shadowed in all paths through the hierarchy. Previously, we would give an ambiguity error. [4.3.2]
24. When binding through imports, types and type members are given preference over namespaces. [4.7.2, 11.6]
25. Changing the default property of a type no longer requires `Shadows`. [9.7.3]
26. Unreserved the contextual keywords `Assembly`, `Ansi`, `Auto`, `Preserve`, `Unicode` and `Until`. [2.3]

### Clarifications/Errata

1. Added a note that full-width/half-width equivalence only works on a whole-token basis (i.e. you can't mix it within a token.) [1.1]
2. There are places in the language that allow regular type names but do not allow array type names. Added clarification to the grammar to call these out. [5.2, 7, 7.2, 7.5.1, 7.8.1, 7.9, 9.1, 9.2.5, 10.10.1.2, 11.10.1, 11.10.2, 11.10.3]
3. The spec incorrectly states that colons can only be used as separators at the statement level. In fact, they can be used almost anywhere. Clarified the grammar and spec. [6, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 6.3, 6.4.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.4.1, 7.5, 7.5.1, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.8.1, 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.7.1, 9.7.2, 10]
4. As a part of the previous bullet point, made labels a statement unto themselves and fixed up the grammar. [10, 10.1]
5. Narrowed the scope of the grammar for delegate declarations to be more accurate. [7.10]
6. Array covariance also includes interface implementation in addition to inheritance. [8.5]
7. When implementing an interface or handling an event, identifiers after a period can match keywords. [9.1, 9.2.6]
8. Split `MustOverride` declarations out from regular method and property declarations. [9.2.1, 9.7]
9. The grammar was wrong for variable declarations â€“ `Dim` is a regular modifier, and not a separate element. [9.6]
10. Spelled out how attributes on `WithEvents` fields are transmitted to the underlying synthetic members. [9.6.2]
11. Invoking an event won't throw an exception if there are no listeners. [10.5.1]
12. Expanded the `RaiseEvent` section to cover the avoidance of race conditions on raising an event. [10.5.1]
13. Clarified that `RaiseEvent` takes an identifier, not an expression. [10.5.1]
14. Covered a corner case with `Mid` assignment. [10.6.3]

21. `MyClass` and `MyBase` cannot stand alone and are moved to the qualified expression production. [11.4.3, 11.6]
22. `TypeOf...Is` is part of the primary category of operator precedence. [11.12.1]
23. A `Handles` clause can have more than one identifier, but only two identifiers are legal. [9.2.6]
24. Conditional compilation only supports a subset of constant expressions. [3.1]
25. Corrected references to `System.Monitor` to `System.Threading.Monitor`. [10.4]
26. Clarified that a compiler can put declarations into a particular namespace by default. [6.4]
27. Re-throwing an exception (`Throw` with no argument) cannot occur inside of a `Finally` block. [10.10.1.3]
28. A conversion from a type to itself is considered widening. [8.8]
29. Tried to clarify the exact behavior of `DirectCast` a bit better than before. [11.11]
30. The element type of a collection in a `For``Each` statement does not have to have an implicit conversion to the loop control variable/expression: the conversion can be of any kind. [10.9.3]
31. Clarified decimal division behavior. [11.13.6]
32. Clarified that overloaded operators are not considered when converting `Nothing` to an empty string for the `&` operator. Also clarified the same behavior applies to the `Like` operator. [11.15, 11.16]
33. Clarified that operations that have `Object` parameters might result in something other than `Integer`. [11.12.2]
34. Added explicit operator type tables. [11.12.3, 11.13.1, 11.13.2, 11.13.3, 11.13.4, 11.13.5, 11.13.6, 11.13.7, 11.13.8, 11.14, 11.15, 11.16, 11.17, 11.17.1, 11.18]
35. Tried to make the "most specific" rules more clear in intent. [11.8.1]
36. Clarified that shadowing a `ParamArray` method by name and signature hides only that signature, even if the shadowing method matches the unexpanded signature of the `ParamArray` method. [4.3.3]
37. Moved the rule about preferring fewer paramarray matches over more during overload resolution earlier in the process to match compiler (and desired) behavior. [11.8.1, 11.8.2]
38. Array-size initializers and array-element initializers cannot be combined. [9.6.3.3]
39. When specifying bounds on an array creation expression and supplying an array-element initializer, the bounds must be specified using constant expressions. [9.6.3.4]
40. Added a discussion of boxing and unboxing, as well as limitations to our anti-aliasing of boxed types design. [8.6]
41. Tried to clarify an obscure rule about enumerated types and `For` loops with `Object` loop control variables. [10.9.2]
42. Clarified that mucking with the loop control variable during an `Object` loop doesn't change the type of the loop. [10.9.2]
43. Noted that delegates and external methods can use duplicate parameter names. [9.2.5]
44. Interfaces have a widening conversion to `Object`. [8.4, 8.8]
45. Interfaces do not inherit from `Object`. [7.8.1]
46. `Object` is reference type. It is not a type that is "neither a reference type nor a value type." [7]

56. Corrected rules on when shared constructors execute. [9.3.2]

### Miscellaneous

1. Changed references to the name of the language from "Microsoft Visual Basic .NET" to "Microsoft Visual Basic." The official name of the language itself is simply "Visual Basic."
2. Moved multi-token punctuators and operators such as `<=` or `>>=` into the lexical grammar for clarity. [2.5, 2.6, 5.2.2, 10.6.2, 10.8.2, 11.14]
3. Removed the `NamespaceOrTypeName` production because it wasn't really needed. [4.7, 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 7]

### Minor Changes

3. Added a new tie-breaker rule to overload resolution: if one overload can be called without having to substitute any optional parameter defaults, but another cannot, then prefer the first [11.8.1]
4. `For Each` now creates a fresh copy of the iteration variable on each loop of the iteration [10.9.3]
5. The compiler now permits methods to be declared which differ only in optional parameters, so long as their signatures are different [9.2]
6. Added a new tie-breaker rule to overload resolution: of two applicable generic overloads, prefer the one where the generic type parameter is "deeper" [11.8.1.3]
7. Added support for `IReadOnlyList` and `IReadOnlyCollection` [7.9, 8.8, 8.9, 11.1.1]

7. Clarified name-lookup rules in "For *identifier* =" and "For Each *identifier* In" statements [10.9.2, 10.9.3]
8. Clarified that nested namespaces are "logical" rather than "lexical" [4.7], and clarified rules for qualified and unqualified type/namespace name lookup [4.7.1, 4.7.2]

10. Clarified that generic types can be constrained to nested types within the type on which they're defined [7.5.2, 7.6.1, 7.8.2]
11. Clarified rules for Imports Alias: they refer to the type or namespace name itself, rather than using the rules for qualified name resolution; and they cannot be open generic types [6.3.1]
